# Python-Data-Analysis-Project
During this python data analysis project, you will learn how to approach data acquisition in various ways and obtain necessary insights from a dataset. By the end of this project, you will successfully load data into Jupyter Notebook and gain some fundamental insights via the Pandas Library. 

In our case, the Diabetes Dataset is an online source and it is in CSV (comma separated value) format. 

Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading and analysis

A little bit about the data set:

Context: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years of age of Pima Indian heritage.

Content: The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

We have 768 rows and 9 columns. The first 8 columns represent the features and the last column represent the target/label.
