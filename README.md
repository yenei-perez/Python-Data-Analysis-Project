# Python-Data-Analysis-Project
During this python data analysis project, you will learn how to approach data acquisition in various ways and obtain necessary insights from a dataset. By the end of this project, you will successfully load data into Jupyter Notebook and gain some fundamental insights via the Pandas Library. 
In our case, the Diabetes Dataset is an online source and it is in CSV (comma separated value) format. 

Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.
