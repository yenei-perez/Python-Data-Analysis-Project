Reading in the Data & Setting the Structure of the DataFrame

# Import pandas library
import pandas as pd

filename = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/data/diabetes.csv"

async def download(url, filename):
    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())

await download(filename, "diabetes.csv")
df = pd.read_csv("diabetes.csv")

#After reading the dataset, we can use the dataframe.head(n) method to check the top n rows of the dataframe, where n is an integer.
#Contrary to dataframe.head(n), dataframe.tail(n) will show you the bottom n rows of the dataframe.
# show the first 5 rows using dataframe.head() method
print("The first 5 rows of the dataframe") 
df.head(5)

#To view the dimensions of the dataframe, we use the .shape parameter.
df.shape



Statistical Overview of dataset

#This method prints information about a DataFrame including the index dtype and columns, non-null values and memory usage.
df.info()

#Pandas describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like 
#percentile, mean, standard deviation, etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric values. 
#When this method is applied to a series of strings, it returns a different output
df.describe()

#The output is a boolean value indicating whether the value that is passed into the argument is in fact missing data.
missing_data = df.isnull()
missing_data.head(5)

"True" stands for missing value, while "False" stands for not missing value.

Count missing values in each column

#Using a for loop in Python, we can quickly figure out the number of missing values in each column. 
#As mentioned above, "True" represents a missing value, "False" means the value is present in the dataset.
#In the body of the for loop the method ".value_counts()" counts the number of "True" values.
for column in missing_data.columns.values.tolist():
    print(column)
    print (missing_data[column].value_counts())
    print("")   
#As you can see above, there is no missing values in the dataset.


Correct data format
Check all data is in the correct format (int, float, text or other).

In Pandas, we use:

.dtype() to check the data type
.astype() to change the data type
Numerical variables should have type 'float' or 'int'.

#Checking that the columns have the correct data type.
df.dtypes


Visualization is one of the best way to get insights from the dataset. 
Seaborn and Matplotlib are two of Python's most powerful visualization libraries.

# import libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

#Creating our visuals
labels= 'Not Diabetic','Diabetic'
plt.pie(df['Outcome'].value_counts(),labels=labels,autopct='%0.02f%%')
plt.legend()

As you can see above, 65.10% females are not Diabetic and 34.90% are Diabetic.

Congrats! You've succesfully ingested data into python, analyzed it & built a visualization around your findings! Good Job, keep up the good work!
plt.show()
